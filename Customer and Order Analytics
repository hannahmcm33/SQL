-- In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'Order ID';


--#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE product = 'iPhone' AND 
       length(orderID) = 6 AND 
       orderID <> 'Order ID';


--#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
       INNER JOIN
       BIT_DB.FebSales Feb ON cust.order_id = FEB.orderid
 WHERE length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid <> 'Order ID';


--#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 ORDER BY price ASC
 LIMIT 1;


--#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity) * price AS revenue,
       product
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 GROUP BY product;

--#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity),
       product,
       sum(quantity) * price AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
 WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
 GROUP BY product;


--#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
       avg(quantity * price) 
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
       LEFT JOIN
       BIT_DB.customers cust ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
 WHERE feb.Quantity > 2 AND 
       length(orderid) = 6 AND 
       orderid = 'Order ID';

--#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product
